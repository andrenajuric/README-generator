  ## Installation
  
  After cloning the repo to your local computer, you must install node modules and packages. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and type: "npm init -y", "npm i" to install the node modules. Once everything is correctly installed, you should be able to run the program by typing "node index.js"


  ## Location

  * [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andrenajuric/readme-generator)

  ## Usage

  After you've installed the necessary node modules and packages, you must enter "node index.js" to run the program in the terminal. You will be asked a series of questions about your project that will be used to generate the markdown file. For some questions that may require more room than others, your default editor will oepn up so that you may type as much as you desire. Once you've answered all the questions, you will see a console.log that says "Success!" and your README.md file will appear in your project folder.
